### Commands

To build the docker image, your current working directory should be in same location as the Dockerfile. Run the
following script

```
docker build . -t fastapiapp
```

this would name the application docker image as fastapiapp.

Test that the application runs successfully when launched using the docker image.

```
docker run -it -p 8000:8000 fastapiapp
```

Open your browser and you should still be able to access the interactive documentation autogenerated for the application
by fastapi.
